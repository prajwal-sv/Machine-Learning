    "### Polymorphism is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface (such as a method name) to represent different underlying forms (data types or classes). In Python, polymorphism allows different classes to implement methods with the same name, and the correct method is called based on the object's class at runtime.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "Both Dog and Cat classes can have a speak() method, and you can call speak() on any animal object without knowing its exact type."
